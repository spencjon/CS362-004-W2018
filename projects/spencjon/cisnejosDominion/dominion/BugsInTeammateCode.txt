Bug Report: Smithy Card 	
Assertion Log: 
SIMPLE FIXED TESTS: Smithy Card
Assertion Failed: Hand Count too large after play (Expected +2) (Actual +3)
Exit? (Y/n):
Test for numPlayers = 2 has failed

Code Pointer: 
dominion.c line 675: 
for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
{
    drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
}

Bug Description: 1 too many cards have been drawn

Outcomes:
Expected: 2 more cards than before (3 drawn cards minus the discarded Smithy card)
Actual: 3 more cards
Interesting/Detail about bug:  I found this bug because of my custom assertions. The Smithy Card is very small, and does not do much. Instead of taking the time to binary search for causality, I just looked at the function where the card draws more cards. It was a simple matter of finding a loop (the only loop there) and making sure it only drew 4 cards and that the function discarded one card. After I fixed the loop to go for 3 draws, the code worked well. 



Bug Report: Adventurer Card 	
SIMPLE FIXED TESTS: Adventurer Card
Assertion Failed: Hand Count too large after play (Expected +1) (Actual +2)
Exit? (Y/n):
Test for numPlayers = 2 has failed

Code Pointer: 
while(drawntreasure<3){
if (state->deckCount[currentPlayer] <1){//if the deck is empty we need to shuffle discard and add to deck
    shuffle(currentPlayer, state);
}

Bug Description: 1 too many cards have been drawn

Outcomes:
Expected: 1 more cards than before (3 drawn cards minus the discarded Smithy card)
Actual: 2 more cards
Interesting/Detail about bug: This bug was found in much the same way as the Smithy Card. I ended up spending less than a minute to find the bug in both, so I would say that the decision of inspection and verification was appropriate.
